		 * What is happening:
		 * 
		 * (This refers to an application that has not set any launchMode
		 * settings and so is using the defaults)
		 * 
		 * You launch an app from the Market or from the Installer. This
		 * launches the root/main activity of the application with the
		 * FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag and no categories. Right now the
		 * applications stack is [ A ]
		 * 
		 * Then you proceed to the next activity in the application. Now the
		 * stack in this task is [ A > B ]
		 * 
		 * Then you press the home key and then relaunch the same application by
		 * pressing it's icon from either the home screen or the app tray.
		 * 
		 * What is expected at this point is that activity B will show, since
		 * that is where you left off. However A is shown and the tasks stack is
		 * [ A > B > A ] This second instance of A is launched with the
		 * following flags: FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK,
		 * FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_IF_NEEDED, and FLAG_ACTIVITY_BROUGHT_TO_FRONT. It
		 * also has the android.intent.category.LAUNCHER category.
		 * 
		 * At this point, if you hit the back key, it will return you to B, as
		 * it was when you left it.
		 * 
		 * Looking at the documentation it seems as if
		 * FLAG_ACTIVITY_BROUGHT_TO_FRONT should only be set for activities that
		 * use the singleTask or singleTop launchModes. However, this
		 * application has not set any launchModes and is therefore using the
		 * default standard launchMode.
		 * 
		 * I assume this is not suppose to happen in this case?
		 * 
		 * I should also note, that once it gets into this weird state, then it
		 * happens everytime the app is launched from the home screen or app
		 * tray. If the task is finished (restarting the phone, force stopping
		 * the app, or hitting back all the way through the stack) will fix this
		 * issue and will no longer launch it incorrectly. It only happens if
		 * you launch the app from the installer or market and then try to
		 * launch it from the launcher.
		 * 
		 * So in summary, why is this happening? Is there a way to prevent it?
		 * 
		 * Workaround
		 * 
		 * In the main/root activity's onCreate method, check if the intent has
		 * the FLAG_ACTIVITY_BROUGHT_TO_FRONT set and if so, call finish(). This
		 * then pops the extra instance of A off the stack [ A > B > A ] becomes
		 * [ A > B ] and from the users perspective, it launches into the
		 * activity they were expecting.
